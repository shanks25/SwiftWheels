                <p>When you use ROC, you trust us with your information. We are committed to

                <h4>The Information We Collect</h4> <br>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3><br>

                <p>ROC collects: <br>
                    - Information that you provide to ROC, such as when you create your ROC account. <br>
                    - Information created when you use our services, such as location, camera, storage and
                    device information.<br>
                    - Information from other sources, such as ROC Captains and third parties that use ROC
                    APIs.<br>
                    The following information is collected by or on behalf of WIT Transports Private Limited:<br>
                    1. Information you provide <br>
                    <b>This may include:</b><br>
                    - User profile: We collect information when you create or update your ROC account. This
                    may include your name, email, phone number, gender, login name and password,
                    government identification numbers such as Social Security number, driver’s license or
                    passport if required by law, birth date and photo. This also includes vehicle or insurance
                    information of drivers and vehicle owner. This also includes the preferences and settings
                    that you enable for your ROC account.<br>
                    - Background check information: We may collect background check information if you
                    sign up to use ROC’s services as a driver. This may include information such as your
                    driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law). This information may be
                    collected by a vendor on ROC’s behalf.<br>
                    - User content: We may collect information that you submit when you contact ROC
                    customer support, provide ratings or compliments for other users, or otherwise contact
                    ROC.<br>
                    2. Information created when you use our services
                    This may include:<br>
                    - Location Information
                    Depending on the ROC services that you use, and your app settings or device permissions,
                    we may collect your precise or approximate location information as determined through data
                    such as GPS, IP address and WiFi.<br>
                    - If you are a driver, ROC collects location information when the ROC app is running in
                    the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on
                    screen) of your device.<br>
                    - If you are a rider and have provided permission for the processing of location data,
                    ROC collects location information when the ROC app is running in the foreground. In
                    certain regions, ROC also collects this information when the ROC app is running in
                    the background of your device if this collection is enabled through your app settings
                    or device permissions.<br>
                    - Riders may not be able to use the ROC app without enabling ROC to collect their
                    location information as this may affect the functionality available on your ROC app.
                    For example, if you do not enable ROC to collect your location information, you will
                    have to manually enter your pickup address. In addition, location information will be
                    collected from the driver during your trip and linked to your account, even if you have
                    not enabled ROC to collect your location information.<br>

                    - Transaction Information<br>

                    We collect transaction details related to your use of our services, including the type of
                    services you requested or provided,date and time the service was provided, amount
                    charged, distance traveled, and payment method. Additionally, if someone uses your
                    promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.<br>
                    - Usage information
                    We collect information about how you interact with our services. This includes information
                    such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other
                    system activity and third-party sites or service you were using before interacting with our
                    services.<br>
                    - Device Information
                    We may collect information about the devices you use to access our services, including the
                    hardware models, device IP address, operating systems and versions, software, file names
                    and versions, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial
                    numbers, device motion information, and mobile network information.
                    We may also collect the image files from the storage for online document submission for the
                    driver application.<br>
                    - Communications data
                    We enable users to communicate with each other and ROC through the ROC apps, and
                    other services. For example, we enable drivers and riders, to call to interact between them.
                    To provide this service, ROC receives some information regarding the calls, including the
                    date and time of the call/text, and the content of the communications. ROC may also use this
                    information for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for
                    safety and security purposes, to improve our products and services and for analytics.<br>

                    3. Information from other sources <br>

                    These may include: <br>

                    - Partner transportation companies (if you are a driver who uses our services through an

                    - The owner of an ROC for Business or ROC Family profile that you use.<br>
                    - Publicly available sources.<br>

                    1. Providing services and features
                    ROC uses the information we collect to provide, personalize, maintain and improve our products.
                    This includes using the information to:<br>
                    - Create and update your account.<br>
                    - Verify your identity.<br>
                    - Enable transportation. This includes automated processing of your information to
                    enable Dynamic Pricing, in which the price of a ride is determined based on constantly
                    varying factors such as the estimated time and distance of the predicted route, estimated

                    2. Safety and security
                    We use your data to help maintain the safety, security and integrity of our services and users. This
                    includes, for example:<br>
                    - Screening drivers prior to enabling their use of our services and at subsequent intervals,
                    including through reviews of background checks where permitted by law, to prevent use of
                    our services by unsafe drivers.<br>
                    - Using information from drivers’ devices to identify unsafe driving behavior such as speeding
                    or harsh braking and acceleration, and to raise awareness among drivers regarding such
                    behaviors.<br>
                    - Using device, location, profile, usage and other information to prevent, detect, and combat
                    fraud or unsafe activities. This includes processing of such information, in certain places, to
                    identify practices or patterns that indicate fraud or risk of safety incidents. This may also
                    include information from third parties. In certain cases such incidents may lead to
                    deactivation by means of an automated decision making process<br>
                    - Using user ratings to encourage improvement by affected users, and as grounds for
                    deactivating users with ratings below a certain minimum as may be required in their region.
                    Calculation and deactivation may be done through an automated decision making process.<br>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3><br>
                <p>Some of ROC&#39;s services and features require that we share information with other

                <h4>Information Retention And Deletion</h4><br>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3><br>

                <p>ROC retains user profile and other information for as long as you maintain your ROC
                    account.<br>
                    ROC retains transaction, location, usage and other information for 7 years in connection
                    with regulatory, tax, insurance or other requirements in the places in which it operates.
                    ROC thereafter deletes or anonymizes such information in accordance with applicable
                    laws.<br>
                    Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Following such request, ROC
                    deletes the information that it is not required to retain, and restricts access to or use of
                    any information it is required to retain.<br>

                    ROC requires user profile information in order to provide its services, and retains such information
                    for as long you maintain your ROC account.<br>
                    ROC retains certain information, including transaction, location, device and usage information, for a
                    minimum of 7 years in connection with regulatory, tax, insurance and other requirements in the
                    places in which it operates. Once such information is no longer necessary to provide ROC&#39;s
                    services, enable customer support, enhance the user experience or other operational purposes,
                    ROC takes steps to prevent access to or use of such information for any purpose other than
                    compliance with these requirements or for purposes of safety, security and fraud prevention and
                    detection.</p><br>

                <h4>Choice And Transparency</h4><br>

                <p>ROC provides means for you to see and control the information that ROC collects,
                    including through:<br>
                    - in-app privacy settings<br>
                    - device permissions<br>
                    - in-app ratings pages<br>

                    You may also request that ROC provide you with explanation, copies or correction of
                    your data.<br>
                    A. PRIVACY SETTINGS<br>
                    The Privacy Settings menu in the ROC rider app gives users the ability to set or update their location
                    and contacts sharing preferences, and their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from ROC.
                    Information on these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the effect of turning off these
                    settings are described below.<br>
                    - Location Information<br>
                    - ROC uses rider&#39;s device location services to make it easier to get a safe, reliable ride
                    whenever you need one. Location data helps improve our services, including
                    pickups, navigation, and customer support.<br>
                    - You may enable/disable, or adjust, ROC&#39;s collection of rider location information at
                    any time through the Privacy Settings menu in the ROC app, or via the settings on
                    your mobile device. If you disable the device location services on your device, use of
                    the ROC app will be affected. For example, you will need to manually enter your
                    pickup or dropoff locations. In addition, location information will be collected from the
                    driver during your trip and linked to your account, even if you have not enabled ROC
                    to collect your location information.<br>

                    - Share Live Location (Riders)<br>
                    - If you have enabled the device location services on your mobile device, you may also
                    enable ROC to share your location with your driver from the time you request a ride
                    to the start of your trip. This makes it easier for your driver to pick you up.
                    - You may enable/disable location sharing with your driver at any time through the
                    Privacy Settings menu in the ROC app. You may use the ROC app if you have not
                    enabled location sharing, but it may be more difficult for your driver to locate you.<br>

                    - Notifications: Account and Trip Updates<br>

                    - ROC provides users with trip status notifications and updates related to your
                    account. These notifications are a necessary part of using the ROC app, and cannot
                    be disabled. However, you may choose the method by which you receive these
                    notifications through the Privacy Settings menu in the ROC app.<br>

                    - Notifications: Discounts and News<br>
                    - You may enable ROC to send you push notifications about discounts and news from
                    ROC. You may enable/disable these notifications at any time through the Privacy
                    Settings menu in the ROC app.<br>

                    B. DEVICE PERMISSIONS
                    Most mobile platforms (Android. have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access
                    without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your
                    consent. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the ROC app seeks before you first
                    use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.<br>
                    C. RATINGS LOOK-UP<br>
                    After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other, as well as give feedback on how the
                    trip went. This two-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps
                    create a respectful, safe environment for both drivers and riders.
                    Your rider rating is available in the main menu of the ROC rider app.
                    Your driver rating is available in the Ratings tab of the ROC Captain app.<br>
